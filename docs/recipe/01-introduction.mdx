# Recipes

Recipes are defined sets of CSS styles composed together that can be easily applied to specific components. Panda allows
you create recipes for your design system or components.

> All recipe styles are generated at build time.

## Base and Variants

As you build out components in your application or design system, you'll discover you need components with similar
styles and only a few differences. To achieve this, we came up with the idea of `base` and `variants` keys for recipes.

- Base refers to the common or shared styles for a specific component
- Variants are the properties that map to the different visual styles of a single component.

Here's an example button recipe

```jsx
// recipes/button.tsx
import { defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const buttonRecipe = defineRecipe({
  ...
  base: {
    display: 'flex',
  },
  variants: {
    visual: {
      funky: { bg: 'red.200', color: 'white' },
      edgy: { border: '1px solid token(colors.red.500)' },
    },
    size: {
      sm: { padding: '4', fontSize: '12px' },
      lg: { padding: '8', fontSize: '40px' },
    },
  },
})

```

From the example above, youâ€™ll notice the base style of the button is the `display: 'flex'`. We then applied the
`visual` and `size` properties to the variant key.

> You can add as many variant properties and values as you need.

## Best Practices

- Leverage css variables in the base styles as much as possible. Makes it easier to theme this component even with JS
- Separate concerns (don't mix styles). Group them in logical groups that mean something visually
- Consider using a virtual palette when needed for more robustness
