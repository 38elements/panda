# Nesting Rules

Panda provides different ways of nesting style declarations.

> Regardless of the approach you use, we require that you use the "&" selector to create nested styles.

## Approach 1: Nesting Styles

For simple scenarios, you might find the grouped "selectors" object too verbose, you can apply simple pseudo or
attribute selectors directly in the css object.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    '&:hover': {
      bg: 'orange.400',
    },
  })}
/>
```

## Approach 2: Condition grouping

CSS styles can be nested using the css conditions in the panda config.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    _hover: {
      bg: 'orange.400',
    },
    sm: {
      fontSize: '50px',
    },
  })}
/>
```

## Caveats

To ensure nesting works as expect, it's required to use the nesting syntax `&` when selecting siblings, parent,
children, etc.

Here are some styles that won't work as expected.

```js
css({
  bg: 'red.500',
  // ‚ùå won't work. It should be `& span`
  span: {
    color: 'pink.500',
  },
})
```
